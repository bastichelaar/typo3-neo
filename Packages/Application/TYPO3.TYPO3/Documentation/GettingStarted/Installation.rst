.. tip::

	TYPO3 Phoenix is built on top of the TYPO3 Flow framework. If you run into technical problems,
	feel free to check the `TYPO3 Flow documentation`_ for possible hints as well.

Requirements
------------

Of course TYPO3 Phoenix has at least the same system requirements as TYPO3 Flow. You can find them
on the `TYPO3 Flow Requirements Documentation`_.

Installation of TYPO3 Phoenix
-----------------------------

.. note::

	If you want to use the current master branch of TYPO3 Phoenix we suggest to use the
	TYPO3 Phoenix Base Distribution: `git://git.typo3.org/TYPO3v5/Distributions/Base.git`

* Fetch the `TYPO3 Phoenix Download`_ packages, or check it out from git using
  `git clone --recursive git://git.typo3.org/TYPO3v5/Distributions/Base.git`

* Set up your virtual host to point to the Web/ directory of your Phoenix installation.

* Go to `http://your.phoenix.uri/setup`. This page checks the basic requirements. If they
  are met, you will be redirected to the setup tool.

* Then, follow the on-screen instructions of the setup tool.

* If all went well you'll get a confirmation the setup is completed, and you can enter the
  frontend or backend of your Phoenix website.
